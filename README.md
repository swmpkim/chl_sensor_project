# Modelling code for chlorophyll sensors  

Code for the project [Refining Techniques for High-Frequency Monitoring of Chlorophyll in the NERRS](https://nerrssciencecollaborative.org/project/Dix20), led by Dr. Nikki Dix of GTM NERR and funded by the NERRS Science Collaborative. This repository contains code in which we try to derive the most [appropriate] predictive model for extracted chlorophyll from YSI EXO2 sensors. See the linked project page for all details,  project outputs, and links to code from other parts of the project!
